Api Endpoints

127.0.0.1/api/register # registers a User using Username Password and also creates a client object using signals



127.0.0.1/api/works # gives all the works with "link" and "work_type"




127.0.0.1/api/works/?work_type=youtube gives all the work with type youtube
127.0.0.1/api/artists/?name=kartik gives out artist with name kartik


used django_filters for filtering from url params


I could not do the artist and work_type search in one url

looking forward to learn more with the team and work fulltime as this will be my offical internship reported to my college and no excuses to not do the work with the team or the work assigned to me.
